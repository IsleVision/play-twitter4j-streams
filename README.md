This is an application using Play Framework and Twitter4j API to retrieve tweets and perform word frequency statistics. The application uses sbt to manage package dependencies and fully supports sbt instructions like "sbt compile/clean/run/test/doc/jacoco". To start the application, simply change the cmd path to the project root path and type sbt run, then after the application fully starts, you should be able to view the web application from localhost:9000. The Play Framework is very advanced, employing AKKA for async http processing, scala template engine to render pagesâ€” you can experience on-the-go compilation and deployment whenever you modify the source codes, which may be impossible for many java MVC frameworks. 
Enjoy.
