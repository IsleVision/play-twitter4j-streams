This application uses Play Framework and Twitter4j API, retrieve tweets and perform word frequency statistics. The application uses sbt to manage package dependencies and fully supports sbt instructions like "sbt compile/clean/run/test/doc/jacoco". To start the application, simply switch to the project root path and type sbt run, then the application starts, you should be able to view the web application from localhost:9000. The Play Framework is very advanced, employing AKKA for async http processing, scala template engine to render pagesâ€” you'll experience on-the-go compilation and deployment whenever you modify the source codes, which is hardly possible for most java MVC frameworks. 
Enjoy.
